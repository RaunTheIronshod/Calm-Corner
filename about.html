                        Calm Corner was created as a space to encourage awareness and understanding of mental health.
                        The goal is to provide accessible resources, practical guidance, and links to professional
                        organisations, all within a calm and supportive environment.

                    <p class="text-large">
                        The project was developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course
                        and also serves as a demonstration of modern web design and development skills. By combining
                        thoughtful design with a mobile-first approach, Calm Corner aims to be both a helpful resource
                        and a showcase of professional development practice.

                                of their struggles alone.</b> We know how isolating and overwhelming life can feel when
                            hope seems out of reach, and that’s why this foundation exists. Our mission is clear — to
                            provide accessible, compassionate, and effective support that helps people not just survive,
                            but rediscover reasons to keep going.

                            judgment, to be treated with respect, and to be given the tools they need to find a way
                            forward. Whether it’s through one-on-one sessions, group support, or connecting people with
                            the right resources, we’re here to create an environment where healing and resilience can

                            approach, addressing the unique circumstances, emotions, and pressures that each individual
                            faces. By combining professional expertise with genuine human care, we aim to build lasting
                            support systems that empower people to reclaim control over their lives.
