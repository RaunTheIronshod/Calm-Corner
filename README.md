# Calm-Corner

Introduction

Calm Corner is a project developed for the Code Institutes Full Stack Software Development course. The website is tailored for mental health awareness and aims to provide resources and support for those suffering with mental health issues. The project scope is from the design environment such as wireframes, colour schemes, font schemes and following through to full deployment of the product. The project is a demonstration of programming skills and design methodology with the intent to portfolio my skillset

User Stories
The use of user stories as a design tool is crucial to aid developers in considering products from the other side of table as the user, helping to predict use case issues before they arise. This does not stop them being a boring element of design

I tailored my user stories to be more general state use rather than critical state use as the website is for general mental wellbeing rather than crisis.

The product is tailored toward providing positive support for those with suffering mental health

The project will provide examples of web development skills in the form of a fully designed and deployed website offering tailored needs to users. It will example software development techniques and standards as well as source control use and documentation along with a practical design showcase.

User Stories
User stories were produced for the websites design process to ensure good functionality and product use from the user, this method helps developers to see the product from the other side of the table, offering useful insights into the users experience of the product

UX design
Knowledge of the user experience is crucial when developing software to avoid re-writes and ensure the product meets the users needs and expectations. It is important to offer the user clear detail and clean website navigation. The use of design methodologies within the research phase of production helped to tailor the UX to be user-friendly and streamlined. Wireframes helped with general page layout and spacing, colour schemes where used to help visual accesibility and appropriate fonts where selected for the same reasoning

Features
The product holds a number of technical coding features such as Favicons, Nav Bars, Cards, Buttons etc… (!!!CONTINUE!!!)

Deployment / Dependencies
The deployment of the website and the projects source control was achieved through git (!!!CONTINUE!!!)

AI implementation
The use of AI in this product is mainly to fill the role of content writer for more lengthy areas of the website with chatgpt, as well as the logo production for the faux partners of the site

Testing and Validation
Persistent personal testing was carried out throughout the project to ensure usability and feature consistency, the repeated mobile first test to ensure all basic device screens dimensions are accommodated for. The website was passed through a series of validators such as HTML, CSS, Js etc….
